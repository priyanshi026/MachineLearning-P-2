Water Quality Prediction Dataset

Introduction
Here we want to forecast the spatio-temporal water quality in terms of the “power of hydrogen (pH)” value for the next day based on the input data, which is the historical data of other water measurement indices. The input data consists of daily samples for 36 sites, providing measurements related to pH values in Georgia, USA. The input features consist of 11 common indices including volume of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance (see details in dataset). The output to predict is the measurement of 'pH, water, unfiltered, field, standard units (Median)'.
There are two major water systems to consider: one is centered on the city of Atlanta while the other is centered on the eastern coast of Georgia. This information indicates spatial depenency among different locations which are important to the forecast.

features	array of strings	1*11	a list of water indices to measure
location_ids	array of integer	37*1	IDs of the water stations
X_te	array of matrices	1*282	test set input data: water indices for 282 contiguous dates until 2018-01-01
•	each element is a 37*11 matrix: 37 spatial locations by 11 features
X_tr	array of matrices	1*423	training set input data: water indices for 423 contiguous dates from 2016-01-28
